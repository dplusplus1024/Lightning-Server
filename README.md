## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## This App uses Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Deploy on DigitalOcean

The easiest way to deploy and host Lightning Server is to use the [DigitialOcean's App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform), which will cost approximately $5.00 per month at the time of this writing. If you choose to use Vercel, functionality will be limited to a working Lightning Address only - you won't get the benefit of Nostr Zap receipts, email notifications, or push notifications.

## To Do

- Continue refactoring, polishing, and optimizing code
- Add my Point of Sale code
- Add code to automatically run the notifier.js
